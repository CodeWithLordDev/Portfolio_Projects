# Don't Build a SaaS Until You Read This: 5 Mistakes That Cost Me $5,000
Building a Software as a Service (SaaS) business sounds like the dream: recurring revenue, scalable growth, and location independence. But the reality? Most SaaS founders burn through thousands of dollars and countless hours before they realize they're building the wrong thing, in the wrong way, for the wrong audience.I learned this the hard way. After spending $5,000 and six months building my first SaaS, I had to face a brutal truth: almost everything I did was wrong. The features nobody wanted. The pricing model that confused everyone. The onboarding experience that drove users away within minutes.This post isn't about celebrating failure—it's about sharing the specific, expensive mistakes I made so you can avoid them. Whether you're a first-time founder or a seasoned developer exploring SaaS, these lessons will save you money, time, and heartbreak.## Table of Contents

## The Reality of Building SaaS in 2026
Before diving into the mistakes, let's acknowledge the current SaaS landscape. With over 30,000 SaaS companies competing for attention and AI tools lowering the barrier to entry, the market is more saturated than ever. According to recent industry data, 90% of SaaS startups fail within the first three years, and most failures can be traced back to a few critical errors made in the early stages.

<br><br>

The good news? These mistakes are entirely preventable. The patterns are predictable, and the solutions are proven. You just need to know what to look for before you start coding.

<br><br>

## Mistake 1: Building Before Validating
### What I Did Wrong
Like many technical founders, I fell in love with a solution before understanding the problem. I had an idea for a project management tool (yes, another one) that I was convinced would revolutionize how remote teams collaborate. I spent three months building features like Gantt charts, time tracking, and custom workflows—all before talking to a single potential customer.

<br><br>

When I finally launched, I got polite feedback and zero paying customers. The brutal truth: I had built features nobody asked for because I never asked anyone what they actually needed.

<br><br>

**Cost of this mistake:** $1,500 in development time and infrastructure

<br><br>

### Why This Happens
This mistake stems from what's called "solution bias"—the tendency to become emotionally attached to your solution rather than the problem you're solving. As developers, we love building. It feels productive. It's comfortable. But building without validation is just expensive procrastination.

<br><br>

### The Right Way: Pre-Sell the Problem First
Here's what validation actually looks like:

<br><br>

**Step 1: Identify a specific, painful problem**Don't start with "I want to build a SaaS." Start with "I've noticed [specific group] struggles with [specific problem]." The more narrow and painful the problem, the better.

<br><br>

Example: Instead of "businesses need better communication tools," try "remote design agencies waste 5+ hours per week chasing client feedback across email threads."

<br><br>

**Step 2: Talk to 10-20 potential customers**Schedule 20-minute discovery calls. Your only goal is to understand if the problem is real and painful enough that people would pay to solve it. Ask:
- How are you currently solving this problem?
- How much time/money does this problem cost you monthly?
- Have you tried other solutions? Why did they fail?
- If I could solve this perfectly, what would that look like?

<br><br>

**Step 3: Create a landing page (not a product)**Build a simple one-page site that describes the solution you're considering. Include:
- The specific problem you solve
- How your solution works (in plain English)
- Pricing tiers (yes, before you build anything)
- An email signup or pre-order option

<br><br>

Use tools like Carrd, Webflow, or even a Notion page. This should take 4-8 hours maximum.

<br><br>

**Step 4: Drive targeted traffic**Spend $100-300 on ads or join communities where your target users hang out. Track conversion rates. A 2-3% email signup rate suggests lukewarm interest. A 5%+ rate with people asking when they can pay is validation.

<br><br>

**Step 5: Pre-sell before you build**This is the ultimate validation: get 10-20 people to pay you (even a discounted early-bird rate) before you write a line of production code. Offer them:
- 50% off lifetime pricing
- Direct access to you during development
- The ability to shape the product

<br><br>

If you can't get 10 pre-sales, you probably can't get 100 paying customers. Save yourself the time and pivot.

<br><br>

### Real-World Example
Sahil Lavingia, founder of Gumroad, famously built the first version in one weekend after validating the problem on Twitter. He tweeted about the concept, got overwhelming interest, and built a basic version before scaling. The company is now worth over $100M.

<br><br>

### Tools for Validation
- **Customer Discovery:** Calendly (scheduling), Zoom (calls), Otter.ai (transcription)
- **Landing Pages:** Carrd, Webflow, Unicorn Platform, Framer
- **Payment/Pre-sales:** Gumroad, Stripe Payment Links, Buy Me a Coffee
- **Analytics:** Google Analytics, Plausible, Fathom
## Mistake 2: Too Many Features (Feature Creep)
### What I Did Wrong
After (mistakenly) assuming I had validated my idea, I made my second critical error: I tried to build everything at once. My initial roadmap included:
- Team collaboration boards
- Time tracking with detailed analytics
- File sharing and version control
- Gantt charts and timeline views
- Custom integrations with Slack, Google Drive, and Trello
- Mobile apps for iOS and Android
- Real-time notifications
- Advanced reporting dashboards

<br><br>

By month four, I had a complex system that did many things poorly instead of one thing exceptionally well. Every new feature introduced bugs. The codebase became unwieldy. Worst of all, when new users signed up, they were overwhelmed by options and unclear about where to start.

<br><br>

**Cost of this mistake:** $1,200 in additional development time and technical debt

<br><br>

### Why This Happens
Feature creep happens because:

<br><br>

1. **Competitive anxiety:** You see competitors with features and assume you need them too

<br><br>

2. **Imposter syndrome:** More features feel more "real" and legitimate

<br><br>

3. **Lack of focus:** Without a clear core value proposition, everything seems important

<br><br>

4. **Customer appeasement:** Early users request features, and you build them all

<br><br>

The irony? Users don't want more features. They want their specific problem solved quickly and effortlessly.

<br><br>

### The Right Way: One Core Workflow, One User Type
The most successful SaaS products launched with radical simplicity:
- **Slack:** Just team messaging (no video, no integrations, no AI initially)
- **Dropbox:** Just file syncing (no collaboration, no comments, no sharing controls)
- **Stripe:** Just payment processing (no fraud detection, no subscriptions, no terminal)
- **Calendly:** Just meeting scheduling (no CRM, no team features, no workflows)

<br><br>

Here's how to achieve the same focus:

<br><br>

**Step 1: Define your Minimum Viable Product (MVP) correctly**Your MVP isn't the smallest product you can build—it's the smallest product that delivers complete value for one specific use case.

<br><br>

Use this framework:
- **One user type:** "Solo freelance designers" not "all creative professionals"
- **One core job:** "Get client approval on designs" not "manage entire projects"
- **One workflow:** "Upload design → Send link → Collect feedback → Mark approved"

<br><br>

**Step 2: Create a feature hierarchy**List every feature you're considering, then categorize:
- **Must-have (Core):** Absolutely required for core workflow (5-8 features max)
- **Nice-to-have (Enhancement):** Makes core workflow better but not essential
- **Future:** Expansion features for different users or use cases
- **Never:** Features that don't support your core value proposition

<br><br>

Be ruthless. If a feature isn't in the critical path of your one core workflow, it's not must-have.

<br><br>

**Step 3: Implement the "feature delay" rule**When someone requests a feature:

<br><br>

1. Document it but don't build it

<br><br>

2. Wait until 10+ users request the same thing

<br><br>

3. Interview those users to understand the underlying need

<br><br>

4. Only then, consider adding it to your roadmap

<br><br>

Often, you'll discover the real need is different from the feature request.

<br><br>

**Step 4: Measure feature usage**Instrument your product to track which features are actually used. You'll likely discover that 80% of value comes from 20% of features. Double down on what works.

<br><br>

### My Simplified Approach (In Hindsight)
If I could rebuild my project management tool, here's what the first version would have been:

<br><br>

**Product:** Design Approval Tool for Freelancers

<br><br>

**One user type:** Freelance designers working with 1-5 clients

<br><br>

**One workflow:**1. Upload design mockups

<br><br>

2. Generate shareable link with password

<br><br>

3. Client leaves feedback with annotations

<br><br>

4. Designer marks items as resolved

<br><br>

5. Client approves final version

<br><br>

That's it. No Gantt charts. No time tracking. No team features. Just one painfully specific problem solved elegantly.

<br><br>

## Mistake 3: Ignoring User Onboarding
### What I Did Wrong
I was so focused on building features that I completely overlooked the first-use experience. When users signed up, they saw a blank dashboard with navigation tabs for all those features I shouldn't have built. There was no guidance, no welcome tour, no clear next step.

<br><br>

The result? My analytics showed that 78% of users never completed a single action after signing up. They logged in, looked around for 30-90 seconds, and never came back. I had a 22% activation rate—disastrous by any standard.

<br><br>

**Cost of this mistake:** $800 in lost potential customers and retention tools added later

<br><br>

### Why This Happens
Developers often think, "The product is intuitive—users will figure it out." This is the curse of knowledge. You've lived with your product for months. Everything is obvious to you. For new users, it's overwhelming and foreign.

<br><br>

Additionally, most founders focus on acquisition (getting sign-ups) without thinking about activation (getting users to experience value quickly). But acquisition without activation is just burning money.

<br><br>

### The Right Way: Guided First-Win Experience
Industry research shows users decide whether to stick with a product within the first 5 minutes. You need to deliver value fast. Here's how:

<br><br>

**Step 1: Identify your "Aha Moment"**This is the moment when users experience the core value of your product. Examples:
- **Slack:** When a team sends their first 2,000 messages
- **Dropbox:** When a file syncs across devices for the first time
- **Calendly:** When someone books their first meeting through your link

<br><br>

For your product, ask: "What's the fastest way for a user to see real value?" Then engineer the onboarding to achieve that moment.

<br><br>

**Step 2: Remove all friction from the first action**Map every step between sign-up and the aha moment. Then eliminate or simplify every single one.

<br><br>

Example first-time flow:
- ❌ Bad: Sign up → Verify email → Complete profile → Watch tutorial → Navigate to section → Create project → Add task
- ✅ Good: Sign up → Immediately shown a pre-populated example → Click "Try it yourself" → Experience value in 30 seconds

<br><br>

**Step 3: Use progressive disclosure**Don't show users everything at once. Reveal features gradually as they need them.

<br><br>

Pattern:

<br><br>

1. First login: One clear action button, empty state with example, no navigation clutter

<br><br>

2. After first action: Unlock next relevant feature with a small tooltip

<br><br>

3. After 3-4 actions: Show full navigation and additional features

<br><br>

**Step 4: Implement interactive onboarding**Static tutorials don't work. Users skip them. Instead, use:
- **Welcome checklists:** Show progress toward the aha moment (e.g., "3 of 5 steps complete")
- **Tooltips on hover:** Contextual help without interruption
- **Guided tasks:** "Let's create your first [thing] together" with step-by-step prompts
- **Video embedded at point of use:** 15-30 second clips showing how to use specific features

<br><br>

**Step 5: Measure and optimize**Track these metrics religiously:
- **Activation rate:** % of sign-ups who complete the core action
- **Time to value:** Average minutes until first aha moment
- **Step completion:** Where users drop off in your onboarding flow

<br><br>

Aim for:
- 40%+ activation rate (great is 60%+)
- Under 5 minutes to first value
- 80%+ completion at each step
### Onboarding Tools and Frameworks
- **Product tours:** Appcues, Userflow, Product Fruits, Intro.js
- **Checklists:** Userlist, CommandBar, Inline Manual
- **Analytics:** Mixpanel, Amplitude, PostHog
- **User session replay:** Hotjar, FullStory, LogRocket
### Real-World Example
When Duolingo optimized their onboarding, they focused on getting users to complete their first lesson within 5 minutes of sign-up. They removed account creation barriers, pre-selected the most popular language, and jumped straight into an interactive lesson. The result? A 20% increase in activation and massive improvements in retention.

<br><br>

## Mistake 4: Wrong Pricing Structure
### What I Did Wrong
I spent weeks agonizing over pricing, then made every mistake in the book:

<br><br>

**My original pricing:**- **Free Plan:** All features, limited to 2 projects
- **Basic ($9/month):** Up to 10 projects, email support
- **Pro ($29/month):** Unlimited projects, integrations, priority support
- **Enterprise ($99/month):** Everything plus custom features

<br><br>

Problems with this structure:

<br><br>

1. **Free plan was too generous:** Users had no reason to upgrade

<br><br>

2. **Unclear value differentiation:** What's really different between plans?

<br><br>

3. **Project limits were arbitrary:** Didn't correlate with customer value

<br><br>

4. **Enterprise plan had no clear target:** Too expensive for small teams, too cheap for actual enterprises

<br><br>

After three months, 89% of my users were on the free plan, and my average revenue per user (ARPU) was $0.73. I was paying more for infrastructure than I was earning.

<br><br>

**Cost of this mistake:** $1,100 in lost revenue and discount experiments

<br><br>

### Why This Happens
Pricing is hard because:

<br><br>

1. **Fear of charging too much:** Leads to underpricing

<br><br>

2. **Competitor anchoring:** Copying competitor prices without understanding their unit economics

<br><br>

3. **Cost-plus thinking:** Pricing based on your costs rather than customer value

<br><br>

4. **Too many options:** Confused customers don't buy

<br><br>

The truth: your initial pricing will be wrong. But some pricing structures are better starting points than others.

<br><br>

### The Right Way: Price by Outcome and Usage
The best SaaS pricing aligns with customer success. When they get more value, they pay more. When they succeed, you succeed.

<br><br>

**Step 1: Understand value metrics**Ask: "What metric most closely represents the value my customer gets from my product?"

<br><br>

Examples:
- **Mailchimp:** Email subscribers (more subscribers = more value)
- **Slack:** Active users (more team members = more value)
- **Intercom:** Conversations (more customer interactions = more value)
- **Zapier:** Tasks (more automations = more value)

<br><br>

Your value metric should:
- Grow naturally as customers get more value
- Be easy to understand and track
- Align with customer budgets (they have more money to spend as they grow)

<br><br>

**Step 2: Create 3 clear tiers**Most successful SaaS companies have 3 paid tiers (some add a free trial or freemium option). Structure them as:

<br><br>

**Starter:** For individuals or tiny teams trying the product
- Price: $19-49/month
- Clear limitations on value metric
- Core features only
- Self-service support

<br><br>

**Professional:** For growing teams using the product daily
- Price: $49-149/month (3-4x Starter)
- Generous limits on value metric
- All features except advanced/enterprise ones
- Email/chat support

<br><br>

**Business:** For established companies with complex needs
- Price: $149-499/month (3-4x Professional)
- High/unlimited limits on value metric
- All features plus advanced security, analytics, etc.
- Priority support + account manager

<br><br>

**Step 3: Use anchoring and clarity**Present prices clearly:
- **Lead with annual pricing:** Show monthly equivalent but charge annually (reduces churn, improves cash flow)
- **Anchor high:** Show Business tier first, then Professional feels reasonable
- **Make one tier obvious:** Use visual design to highlight your target tier (usually Professional)
- **Show what's included:** Clear feature lists with checkmarks, not vague "everything in X plus..."

<br><br>

**Step 4: Test fearlessly**You can change pricing more easily than you think. When you do:
- Grandfather existing customers at old pricing
- A/B test with new sign-ups
- Survey customers: "At what price does this become too expensive? A bargain? Too cheap to be good?"

<br><br>

**Step 5: Don't anchor to competitors blindly**If competitors charge $X, you don't have to. Price based on:
- Your positioning (premium vs budget)
- Your value metric difference
- Your target customer segment
- Your unit economics
### Revised Pricing (What I Should Have Done)
**Design Approval Tool for Freelancers****Starter ($19/month):**- Up to 5 active projects
- Unlimited clients
- Basic feedback tools
- Email support

<br><br>

**Professional ($59/month):**- Up to 25 active projects
- Custom branding on client portals
- Advanced feedback annotations
- Priority chat support
- Client analytics

<br><br>

**Business ($149/month):**- Unlimited projects
- Team collaboration (3+ designers)
- Client CRM integration
- Dedicated account manager
- White-label options

<br><br>

**Value metric:** Active projects (clear, grows with business success)

<br><br>

**Target tier:** Professional (59% of customers)

<br><br>

**ARPU goal:** $60+ (10x higher than my original $0.73)

<br><br>

### Pricing Tools and Resources
- **Price optimization:** Price Intelligently (Profitwell), PricingSaaS, Maxio
- **Competitor research:** SaaS pricing pages, ProductHunt, G2 reviews
- **Surveys:** Typeform, SurveyMonkey, useresearch.com
- **Reading:** "The SaaS Pricing Bible" by Patrick Campbell, "Monetizing Innovation"
## Mistake 5: No Distribution Plan
### What I Did Wrong
This was my most naive assumption: "If I build it, they will come."

<br><br>

I launched on Product Hunt, got 47 upvotes, and... nothing. A trickle of traffic for two days, then silence. I posted on Reddit and got downvoted for self-promotion. I sent cold emails that went unanswered.

<br><br>

After six months of building, I had 34 total sign-ups (12 were friends and family). I had created a product in a vacuum, with zero audience, zero credibility, and zero distribution channels.

<br><br>

**Cost of this mistake:** $400 in failed ads plus immeasurable opportunity cost

<br><br>

### Why This Happens
Technical founders often believe product quality is everything. But in reality, distribution is equally—if not more—important than product. There are graveyards full of excellent products that nobody knew about.

<br><br>

The misconception: "Marketing comes after the product is built." The reality: distribution should be built alongside the product.

<br><br>

### The Right Way: Build Distribution While Building Product
The best founders start building an audience 6-12 months before launching. Here's how:

<br><br>

**Step 1: Pick 1-2 primary channels**You can't be everywhere. Choose channels where:
- Your target customers actively spend time
- You have genuine interest or expertise
- You can commit to consistent effort

<br><br>

Common channels by customer type:
- **B2B SaaS:** LinkedIn, industry blogs, newsletters, webinars, SEO
- **Developer tools:** GitHub, Dev.to, Twitter, Reddit (r/programming), YouTube
- **Design tools:** Dribbble, Behance, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok
- **Small business tools:** Facebook groups, industry forums, local events, partnerships

<br><br>

**Step 2: Start creating content 6 months before launch**Content marketing isn't about promoting your product—it's about solving problems and building trust.

<br><br>

Framework:
- **Teach what you know:** Share tactical advice related to your product space
- **Document your journey:** Build in public, share progress and lessons
- **Create genuine value:** Tools, templates, guides that help people immediately

<br><br>

Examples:
- **Blog posts:** "The 5-Minute Design Feedback Framework" (targets your users, solves their problem)
- **Video tutorials:** "How I Get Client Approvals 3x Faster" (showcases your approach)
- **Twitter threads:** "10 lessons from 100 client projects" (builds credibility)
- **Newsletter:** Weekly design and client management tips

<br><br>

**Post frequency:**- Twitter/LinkedIn: 3-5x per week
- Blog posts: 1-2x per month
- YouTube: 1x per week
- Newsletter: 1x per week

<br><br>

**Step 3: Build an email list from day one**Email is your owned channel—no algorithm can take it away.

<br><br>

Create a lead magnet (free resource in exchange for email):
- Checklist: "The Complete Design Handoff Checklist"
- Template: "Client Feedback Email Templates That Get Fast Responses"
- Mini-course: "5-Day Email Course: Streamline Your Design Workflow"

<br><br>

Use ConvertKit, Mailchimp, or Buttondown. Aim for 500-1,000 subscribers before launch.

<br><br>

**Step 4: Engage in communities (without spamming)**Join where your users hang out and be genuinely helpful for months before you mention your product.

<br><br>

Pattern:
- **Month 1-3:** Only answer questions, share knowledge, be helpful
- **Month 4-6:** Mention you're building something in your profile or when directly relevant
- **Month 7+:** Share your launch when it genuinely helps someone asking a question

<br><br>

Communities:
- Reddit (specific subreddits)
- Facebook groups
- Slack/Discord communities
- Industry forums (Designer Hangout, Indie Hackers, etc.)

<br><br>

**Step 5: Partner with complementary tools**Find 3-5 tools your customers already use and build relationships:
- Integration partnerships (technical)
- Co-marketing (webinars, bundle discounts)
- Affiliate arrangements
- Guest content swaps

<br><br>

Example: If building a design feedback tool, partner with:
- Figma (integration)
- Notion (design system templates)
- Dribbble (showcase gallery)
- Freelancer communities (co-marketing)
### Launch Strategy
When you do launch, coordinate:

<br><br>

**Week before:**- Tease to email list (3 emails)
- Post countdown content
- Line up 10-20 people to support launch

<br><br>

**Launch day:**- Product Hunt (optimize listing, engage all day in comments)
- Email list announcement
- Social media posts (all channels)
- Community shares (where appropriate)
- Press outreach to niche publications

<br><br>

**Week after:**- Thank you email to supporters
- Case study from early user
- Retrospective content ("What I learned from my Product Hunt launch")

<br><br>

**Month after:**- Resume regular content cadence
- Convert interest into sales through email nurture sequence
### Distribution Tools
- **Social scheduling:** Buffer, Hypefury, Taplio (LinkedIn)
- **Email marketing:** ConvertKit, Mailchimp, Loops
- **Content creation:** Notion, Hemingway Editor, Grammarly
- **SEO:** Ahrefs, Semrush (if budget allows), Google Search Console (free)
- **Community:** Circle, Discord, Slack
### Real-World Example
Nathan Barry built ConvertKit (now $30M+ ARR) by blogging about email marketing for professional creators 18 months before launch. He had 10,000 email subscribers who were his ideal customers before he wrote a line of code. At launch, he had immediate traction because he had built trust and audience first.

<br><br>

## The Cost Breakdown: Where $5,000 Went
Here's the detailed accounting of my mistakes:
| Mistake | Cost | Details |
|---------|------|---------|
| Building before validating | $1,500 | 3 months of full-time development (opportunity cost), AWS infrastructure ($45/month × 4) |
| Too many features | $1,200 | Additional development time, increased infrastructure costs, bug fixes |
| Ignoring onboarding | $800 | Lost potential customers (34 sign-ups × $29/month × 50% activation loss × 2 months) |
| Wrong pricing | $1,100 | Lost revenue from underpricing, discount experiments that failed |
| No distribution | $400 | Failed ad campaigns ($250), cold email tools ($150) |
| **Total** | **$5,000** | Plus 6 months of opportunity cost |

<br><br>

This doesn't include:
- 6 months of my time that could have been consulting ($30,000-50,000 in lost income)
- Psychological cost of failure
- Damage to confidence
## What I Would Do Differently Today
If I were starting over tomorrow, here's my exact playbook:

<br><br>

### Month 1-2: Validate and Build Audience
- Week 1-2: 20 customer discovery calls
- Week 3-4: Create landing page with pricing and pre-sell to 10 people ($500 in revenue)
- Start content: 3 blog posts, launch newsletter, engage in 2 communities daily
### Month 3-4: Build MVP
- Week 5-8: Build absolute minimum viable product—one workflow, one user type
- Focus on: Authentication, core workflow (5-6 features max), basic payment integration
- Continue content: Weekly blog post, daily community engagement, grow list to 300 people
### Month 5-6: Private Beta and Onboarding
- Week 9-10: Launch to 10 pre-sale customers, 20 beta testers
- Obsessively watch onboarding: Live calls, session recordings, track every drop-off point
- Week 11-12: Fix onboarding flow until 60% activation rate
- Continue content: Case studies from beta users, grow list to 500 people
### Month 7: Public Launch
- Product Hunt launch coordinated with email list (500 people)
- First 100 users: Personally onboard, collect feedback, iterate
- Hit $1,000 MRR in first month (30-35 customers at $29-39/month)
### Month 8-12: Grow and Refine
- Double down on working distribution channels
- Optimize onboarding (70% activation target)
- Add 1 feature per month based on user feedback
- Hit $5,000 MRR by month 12

<br><br>

**Total investment:** $500 in tools + my time

<br><br>

**Expected outcome:** $5,000 MRR in 12 months (vs my actual $25 MRR in 6 months)

<br><br>

## Final Takeaway
Building a successful SaaS isn't about having the best idea or being the most technical founder. It's about:

<br><br>

1. **Validation first:** Prove people will pay before you build

<br><br>

2. **Ruthless focus:** One workflow, one user type, delivered exceptionally

<br><br>

3. **Activation obsession:** Get users to value in under 5 minutes

<br><br>

4. **Value-based pricing:** Align pricing with customer success

<br><br>

5. **Distribution from day one:** Build audience while building product

<br><br>

The entrepreneurs who succeed aren't smarter—they just avoid these five expensive mistakes. Every dollar and hour you save by learning from my failures is a dollar and hour you can invest in actually building something people love.

<br><br>

Don't make my mistakes. Don't waste $5,000 and six months building in the dark. Validate, simplify, and distribute from day one.

<br><br>

## Frequently Asked Questions
### How much money do I need to start a SaaS business?
You can start with less than $500 if you avoid my mistakes. Essential costs: domain name ($10), hosting ($5-20/month), email tool ($0-20/month), and payment processing (free until you have revenue). The biggest investment is your time—expect 3-6 months of focused work.

<br><br>

### Should I build a SaaS as a solo founder or with a cofounder?
Both can work. Solo founders have complete control and keep all equity but bear all the work. Cofounders bring complementary skills (technical + marketing, for example) and shared burden but require excellent communication. Choose based on your strengths and gaps. If you're technical but hate marketing, find a cofounder who loves distribution.

<br><br>

### How long does it take to build a minimum viable SaaS product?
With modern tools and proper scoping, 4-8 weeks of full-time work is realistic for an MVP. Part-time, expect 3-4 months. The key is ruthless scoping—if you're planning for longer, you're probably building too many features.

<br><br>

### What's a good activation rate for a new SaaS product?
Industry average is 25-40%. Good is 50-60%. Excellent is 70%+. If you're below 30%, your onboarding is broken. Focus on this metric before anything else—users who never activate will never pay.

<br><br>

### When should I quit my job to work on my SaaS full-time?
Don't quit until you hit $3,000-5,000 in monthly recurring revenue (MRR) or have 6-12 months of runway saved. Many successful founders built to $10K MRR while working full-time. The pressure of bills doesn't make you more creative—it makes you desperate.

<br><br>

### How do I know if I should pivot or persevere?
Pivot if after 6 months of genuine effort (not just building, but talking to customers and iterating), you can't get 10 paying customers. Persevere if you have early traction but need to refine positioning, pricing, or features. The signal: are people paying, even if it's messy? That's worth persevering.

<br><br>

### What tech stack should I use to build my SaaS?
Use what you know best. Seriously. The tech stack doesn't matter for your first 1,000 customers. Common choices: React + Node.js, Next.js + Vercel, Ruby on Rails, Django + Python. For no-code options: Bubble, Webflow + Airtable, or Softr. Don't learn a new stack while building your first SaaS—you have enough challenges already.

<br><br>

### How much should I spend on marketing before I have product-market fit?
Almost nothing on paid ads. Invest time, not money, in content and community. Once you have 10-20 paying customers and strong activation, then experiment with $500-1,000 in paid acquisition to test channels. Before product-market fit, throwing money at ads is just expensive validation that your product isn't ready.

<br><br>

### Should I offer a free trial or freemium model?
For B2B SaaS: Free trial (14-30 days) works best. Require a credit card for higher-quality leads. For B2C or viral products: Freemium can work if your free tier creates value but has clear upgrade incentive. The key: your free option should never be "good enough" that users never upgrade.

<br><br>

### What are the most important metrics to track?
In priority order:

<br><br>

1. **Activation rate:** % of sign-ups who complete core action

<br><br>

2. **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR):** Total predictable revenue

<br><br>

3. **Churn rate:** % of customers who cancel monthly

<br><br>

4. **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):** How much you spend to get one customer

<br><br>

5. **Lifetime Value (LTV):** Average revenue per customer over their lifetime

<br><br>

Aim for LTV:CAC ratio of 3:1 or better.
